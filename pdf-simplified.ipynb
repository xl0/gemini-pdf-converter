    "\n",
    "Unlike Madkdown or HTML, the data in a PDF page does not always come in the natural order. \n",
    "It's more like a canvas, with a list of elements like:\n",
    "- `(\"World\", font, location, transforms, ...)`\n",
    "- `(\"Hello\", font, location, transforms, ...)`\n",
    "- `([Image], location, transforms, ...)`\n",
    "\n",
    "that are placed at the correct location during rendering. It's generally not possible to reliably extract text  \n",
    "in the natural order, and it gets especially messy with formulas:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Attention](assets/attention.png)\n",
    "```\n",
    "In practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together | {...}\n",
    "into a matrix | {...}\n",
    " Q | {...}\n",
    ". The keys and values are also packed together into matrices | {...}\n",
    " K | {...}\n",

    "\n",
    "Especially for a scanned PDF, we need to use AI to correctly extract the text  \n",
    "and image from the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extract text and image from the document\n",
    "- 🤖 Ask Gemini if the images look good.\n",
    "    - If the images look good, we don't need to do the extra extraction step.\n",
    "    - If they don't look good:\n",
    "        - 🤖 Use Gemini to find bounding boxes for all images in the page.\n",
    "        - Extract images from the bounding boxes.\n",
    " - 🤖 Give the page image, extracted text, and extracted images to Gemini, and generate markdown with references to images.\n",
    "- Combine the markdown for all pages into a single document.\n",
    "- 🤖 Pass the full document to Gemini and ask it to brush up the formatting to make it consistent across pages.\n",
    "    - This step requires multi-step generation and context caching.\n",
    "- Save the resulting markdown and images.\n",
    "\n",
    "### UI\n",
    "There us a UI at the end of the notebok. Run the notebook (with `RUN_DEV_CELLS=False` for speed) and use it to convert your PDFs:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/ui.png\" width=\"400\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "### API key\n",
    "Set `GEMINI_API_KEY=\"your very secret key\"` in the environment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "Durig this fun projects I found:\n",
    "- Gemini works best with simple and concise tasks. Initially I tried to combine multiple tasks into one step, and the model was struggling.\n",
    "- Gemini is able to find figures/plots/images in a PDF page, but it's not 100% reliable on its own.\n",
    "- Gemini is excellent at converting between plain text and different text-based formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🚩🥽 Recitation error\n",
    "Gemini will fail with finish reason: `RECITATION` that triggers when the model is generating large chunks of  \n",
    "material from some Google's database, regardless of license. This of couse makes using Gemini for format  \n",
    "conversion challenging, as the generated text will often match large chunks of known material.\n",
    "\n",
    "**GOOGLE: Pretty please, allow recitation if the recited material is also fully/largely present in the models input!**\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, this mechanism can be fooled easily. I ask the model to insert\n",
    "```\n",
    "[<end of paragraph>]\n",
    "```\n",
    "after every paragraph, and cut them out later. This seems to be enough to avoid this error.\n",
