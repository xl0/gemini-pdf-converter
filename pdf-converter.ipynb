    "Unlike Madkdown or HTML, the data in a PDF page does not always come in the natural order. \n",

    "- `(\"World\", font, location, transforms, ...)`\n",
    "- `(\"Hello\", font, location, transforms, ...)`\n",

    "On top of this, many older PDFs are scanned paper documents, and contain poorly  \n",
    "recognized text, no text at all, full-page images instead of text, or images of page fragments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Especially for a scanned PDF, we need to use AI to correctly extract the text  \n",
    "and image from the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extract text and image from the document\n",
    "- 🤖 Ask Gemini if the images look good.\n",
    "    - If the images look good, we don't need to do the extra extraction step.\n",
    "    - If they don't look good:\n",
    "        - 🤖 Use Gemini to find bounding boxes for all images in the page.\n",
    "        - Extract images from the bounding boxes.\n",
    " - 🤖 Give the page image, extracted text, and extracted images to Gemini, and generate markdown with references to images.\n",
    "- Combine the markdown for all pages into a single document.\n",
    "- 🤖 Pass the full document to Gemini and ask it to brush up the formatting to make it consistent across pages.\n",
    "    - This step requires multi-step generation and context caching.\n",
    "- Save the resulting markdown and images.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Long context\n",
    "During the second pass, we need to pass the whole document (text only) through Gemini Flash again, to fix small conversation errors and inconsistencies. We break the 100K token barrier at around 60-80 pages for a typical research paper, depending on the text density. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Caching\n",
    "\n",
    "During the second pass, the input text is cached, as multiple calls to the model are required in order to re-generate the complete document.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### UI\n",
    "There us a UI at the end of the notebok. Run the notebook (with `RUN_DEV_CELLS=False` for speed) and use it to convert your PDFs:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/xl0/gemini-pdf-converter/blob/master/assets/ui.png?raw=true\" width=\"400\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "### API key\n",
    "Set `GEMINI_API_KEY=\"your very secret key\"` in the environment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "Durig this fun projects I found:\n",
    "- Gemini works best with simple and concise tasks. Initially I tried to combine multiple tasks into one step, and the model was struggling.\n",
    "- Gemini is able to find figures/plots/images in a PDF page, but it's not 100% reliable on its own.\n",
    "- Gemini is excellent at converting between plain text and different text-based formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🚩🥽 Recitation error\n",
    "Gemini will fail with finish reason: `RECITATION` that triggers when the model is generating large chunks of  \n",
    "material from some Google's database, regardless of license. This of couse makes using Gemini for format  \n",
    "conversion challenging, as the generated text will often match large chunks of known material.\n",
    "\n",
    "**GOOGLE: Pretty please, allow recitation if the recited material is also fully/largely present in the models input!**\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, this mechanism can be fooled easily. I ask the model to insert `[<end of paragraph>]` after every paragraph, and cut them out later. This seems to be enough to avoid this error.\n",

On each of these projected versions of queries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding $d_v$-dimensional output values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as depicted in Figure 2.\n",

Mix well and allow to stand for 10 minutes or longer at room temperature. 0.10 ml. of Reagent E is added very rapidly and mixed within a second or two (see below). After 30 minutes or longer, the sample is read in a calorimeter or spectrophotome- ter. For the range 5 to 25 γ of protein per ml. of final volume, it is desirable to make readings at or near λ = 750 mμ, the absorption peak. For stronger solutions, the readings may be kept in a workable range by reading near λ = 500 mμ (Fig. 2). Calculate from a standard curve, and, if necessary, make appropriate correction for differences between the color value of the working standard and the particular proteins being measured (see below).\n",
       "\n",
       "It is unnecessary to bring all the samples and standards to the same volume before the addition of the alkaline copper reagent, provided cor- rections are made for small differences in final volume. The critical vol- umes are those of the alkaline copper and Folin reagents.\n",
       "\n",
       "If the protein is present in an already very dilute solution (less than 25 γ per ml.), 0.5 ml. may be mixed with 0.5 ml. of an exactly double strength Reagent C and otherwise treated as above.\n",
       "\n",
       "Insoluble Proteins, etc.--Many protein precipitates, e.g. tungstate pre- cipitates, will dissolve readily in the alkaline copper reagent. However, after proteins have been precipitated with trichloroacetic or perchloric acid, for example, they will dissolve rather poorly in the 0.1 N alkali of this reagent. They become even harder to dissolve if subsequently ex- tracted with fat solvents, and still more so if dried at 100°.\n",
       "\n",
       "It is not possible to cover all cases, but the following may be helpful in measuring the protein of acid precipitates. If the amount of protein is not great, so that it is spread rather thinly, it will usually dissolve in ½ hour or so in 1 N NaOH at room temperature. Therefore, one may add, for example, 0.1 ml. of 1 N NaOH to 5 to 100 γ of precipitated protein.\n",

Add 5 ml. of Reagent C, and, after 10 minutes, 0.5 ml. of Reagent E. Readings are taken after 30 minutes with the No. 66 filter. If the readings are too high, substi- tute the No. 54 filter for sample, standards, and blanks.\n",

       "With larger samples, or very stubborn precipitates, it may be necessary to heat for 10 minutes or more at 100” in 1 N alkali. Although this may lower the readings, they will be reproducible and can be measured with similarly treated standards.2  \n",

       "Microanalysis—With a Beckman spectrophotometer adapted to 0.05 ml. volume (12), as little as 0.2 γ of protein may be measured with reasonable precision. Aside from reducing the volumes of sample and reagents, the only necessary change is to use sufficiently slender tubes for the re- action. If the tubes are too large in diameter, low values will result.  \n",

       "The following is illustrative of a procedure in which it is desired to pre- cipitate the protein in order, for example, to measure an acid-soluble con- stituent of the same specimen.

       "2 Bovine serum albumin is especially difficult to redissolve after precipitation. Several 40 mg. samples were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, washed with alcohol and isopropyl ether, and dried. These samples dissolved very slowly in 2 ml. of 1 N NaOH. However, after standing overnight, the protein appeared to be nearly all dissolved and aliquots gave readings 97 per cent of those obtained with non-precipitated samples. Other samples were heated for 30 minutes at 100” in 1 N NaOH. These samples dissolved and the solution turned slightly yellow. The final readings checked well but were only 82 per cent of those obtained with non- precipitated samples. Possibly, heating at lower temperature with the 1 N NaOH would have sufficed, although heating with weaker alkali would not have been effec- tive, judging from other experience. The use of stronger alkali than 1 N did not appear to be an improvement.  \n",

Filling or emptying of a beaker full of tubes (tall form of beaker without lip) is accomplished by slow centrifugation for a few seconds. For emptying, the tubes are transferred upside down to a second beaker with a false bottom of stainless steel screen. With the slow centrifugation required beakers will not be broken.  \n",

       "*Reaction with Copper in Alkaline Solution*--The salient features of this reaction follow. (1) The color obtained in the absence of copper is probably attributable entirely to the tyrosine and tryptophan content (16, 17), and this is not greatly increased by alkaline pretreatment ((4-6) and Table I). (2) In the presence of copper, alkaline treatment of proteins results in a 3- to 15-fold increase in color, but, in contrast, the presence of copper has only a small effect on the color obtained with free tyrosine and tryptophan (Herriott (17, 18) and Table I). (3) The reaction with copper, although not instantaneous, is nearly complete in 5 or 10 minutes at room temperature under the prescribed conditions. Heating to 100° or increasing the concentration of alkali accelerates the reaction with copper without changing the final color. (4) Pretreatment with alkali alone does not alter the subsequent reaction with copper in alkaline solution. Even pretreatment for an hour at 60° with 2 N NaOH, or for 5 minutes at 100° with 1 N NaOH, when followed by the usual copper treatment, has almost no effect on subsequent color.² Prolonged heating with strong alkali will, however, decrease the final color.²\n",

(2) At this pH the reagent is only reactive for a short time (16). It is for this reason that even a few seconds delay in complete mixing will lessen the amount of color (Fig. 1). The decrease in reactivity of the reagent appears to be a function of the disappearance of the original yellow color of the phosphomolybdate (half time of 8 seconds (Fig. 1)) and is presumably due to dissociation of the phosphate from the molybdate. Surprisingly, the color with protein continues to develop for a number of minutes after the reagent itself has become unreactive to freshly added protein (Fig. 1). Possibly the primary reduction product rearranges, since the absorption spectrum changes in shape between 3 minutes and 30 minutes (Fig. 2). (3)\n",

       "DISCUSSION\n",
       "\n",
       "The measurement of protein with copper and the Folin reagent has certain advantages. (1) It is as sensitive as with Nessler’s reagent, yet requires no digestion. (2) It is 10 or 20 times more sensitive than measurement of the ultraviolet absorption at λ = 280 mμ and is much more specific and much less liable to disturbance by turbidities. (3) It is several fold more sensitive than the ninhydrin reaction (23) and is somewhat simpler, as well as much easier to adapt for small scale analyses. Free amino acids give much more color than proteins with the ninhydrin reaction, whereas the reverse is true with the Folin reagent. (4) It is 100 times more sensitive than the biuret reaction.  \n",
       "\n",
       "There are two major disadvantages of the Folin reaction. (a) The amount of color varies with different proteins. In this regard it is less constant than the biuret reaction, but more constant than the absorption at λ = 280 mμ. (b) The color is not strictly proportional to concentration.  \n",
       "\n",
       "From a consideration of the advantages and disadvantages, the reasonable applications of the copper-Folin reaction would seem to include (1) measurement of protein during enzyme fractionations, etc., (2) measurement of mixed tissue proteins, particularly when absolute values are not needed, (3) measurement of very small absolute amounts of protein, or highly diluted protein (e.g., spinal fluid) or protein mixed with colored substances or other nitrogen-containing substances, and (4) analyses of large numbers of similar protein samples, such as antigen-antibody precipitates.  \n",
       "\n",
       "SUMMARY\n",
       "\n",
       "1. A study is presented of the measurement of proteins with the Folin phenol reagent after alkaline copper treatment. The basic reactions have certain peculiarities which need to be taken into consideration in using this reagent.  \n",
       "\n",
       "2. Directions are given for measurement of proteins in solution and proteins which have been precipitated with acid, etc. A micro procedure is also described for the measurement of as little as 0.2 γ of protein.  \n",
       "\n",
       "3. The differences in the amount of color obtained with a number of proteins is recorded. Interfering substances are listed.\n",
       "\n",
       "LOWRY, ROSEBROUGH, FARR, AND RANDALL  275\n",

On the basis of this titration dilute the Folin reagent (about 2-fold) to make it 1 N in acid.

       "Procedure for Proteins in Solution or Readily Soluble in Dilute Alkali--(Directions are given for a final volume of 1.1 to 1.3 ml., but any multiple or fraction of the volumes given may be employed as desired.) \n",
       "\n",
       "To a sample of 5 to 100 γ of protein in 0.2 ml. or less in a 3 to 10 ml. test-tube, 1 ml. of Reagent C is added. Mix well and allow to stand for 10 minutes or longer at room temperature. 0.10 ml. of Reagent E is added very rapidly and mixed within a second or two (see below). After 30 minutes or longer, the sample is read in a calorimeter or spectrophotometer. For the range 5 to 25 γ of protein per ml. of final volume, it is desirable to make readings at or near λ = 750 mμ, the absorption peak. For stronger solutions, the readings may be kept in a workable range by reading near λ = 500 mμ (Fig. 2). Calculate from a standard curve, and, if necessary, make appropriate correction for differences between the color value of the working standard and the particular proteins being measured (see below). \n",
       "\n",
       "It is unnecessary to bring all the samples and standards to the same volume before the addition of the alkaline copper reagent, provided corrections are made for small differences in final volume. The critical volumes are those of the alkaline copper and Folin reagents. \n",
       "\n",
       "If the protein is present in an already very dilute solution (less than 25 γ per ml.), 0.5 ml. may be mixed with 0.5 ml. of an exactly double strength Reagent C and otherwise treated as above. \n",
       "\n",
       "Insoluble Proteins, etc.--Many protein precipitates, e.g. tungstate precipitates, will dissolve readily in the alkaline copper reagent. However, after proteins have been precipitated with trichloroacetic or perchloric acid, for example, they will dissolve rather poorly in the 0.1 N alkali of this reagent. They become even harder to dissolve if subsequently extracted with fat solvents, and still more so if dried at 100°. \n",
       "\n",
       "It is not possible to cover all cases, but the following may be helpful in measuring the protein of acid precipitates. If the amount of protein is not great, so that it is spread rather thinly, it will usually dissolve in ½ hour or so in 1 N NaOH at room temperature. Therefore, one may add, for example, 0.1 ml. of 1 N NaOH to 5 to 100 γ of precipitated protein. \n",
       "\n",
       "¹ For example, with the Klett colorimeter, transfer 25 to 500 γ of protein in not over 1 ml. volume to a colorimeter tube. Add water if necessary to make 1 ml. Add 5 ml. of Reagent C, and, after 10 minutes, 0.5 ml. of Reagent E. Readings are taken after 30 minutes with the No. 66 filter. If the readings are too high, substitute the No. 54 filter for sample, standards, and blanks. \n",

       "With larger samples, or very stubborn precipitates, it may be necessary to heat for 10 minutes or more at 100” in 1 N alkali. Although this may lower the readings, they will be reproducible and can be measured with similarly treated standards.<sup>2</sup> \n",

       "Microanalysis—With a Beckman spectrophotometer adapted to 0.05 ml. volume (12), as little as 0.2 γ of protein may be measured with reasonable precision. Aside from reducing the volumes of sample and reagents, the only necessary change is to use sufficiently slender tubes for the reaction. If the tubes are too large in diameter, low values will result. \n",
       "\n",
       "The following is illustrative of a procedure in which it is desired to precipitate the protein in order, for example, to measure an acid-soluble constituent of the same specimen. In this example, it is assumed that the sample volume is negligible. Otherwise a smaller volume of more concentrated trichloroacetic acid would be used. \n",

However, after standing overnight, the protein appeared to be nearly all dissolved and aliquots gave readings 97 per cent of those obtained with non-precipitated samples. Other samples were heated for 30 minutes at 100” in 1 N NaOH. These samples dissolved and the solution turned slightly yellow. The final readings checked well but were only 82 per cent of those obtained with non-precipitated samples. Possibly, heating at lower temperature with the 1 N NaOH would have sufficed, although heating with weaker alkali would not have been effective, judging from other experience. The use of stronger alkali than 1 N did not appear to be an improvement. \n",

       "The salient features of this reaction follow. (1) The color obtained in the absence of copper is probably attributable entirely to the tyrosine and tryptophan content (16, 17), and this is not greatly increased by alkaline pretreatment ((4-6) and Table I). (2) In the presence of copper, alkaline treatment of proteins results in a 3- to 15-fold increase in color, but, in contrast, the presence of copper has only a small effect on the color obtained with free tyrosine and tryptophan (Herriott (17, 18) and Table I). (3) The reaction with copper, although not instantaneous, is nearly complete in 5 or 10 minutes at room temperature under the prescribed conditions. Heating to 100° or increasing the concentration of alkali accelerates the reaction with copper without changing the final color. (4) Pretreatment with alkali alone does not alter the subsequent reaction with copper in alkaline solution. Even pretreatment for an hour at 60° with 2 N NaOH, or for 5 minutes at 100° with 1 N NaOH, when followed by the usual copper treatment, has almost no effect on subsequent color.<sup>2</sup> Prolonged heating with strong alkali will, however, decrease the final color.<sup>2</sup> \n",

(2) At this pH the reagent is only reactive for a short time (16). It is for this reason that even a few seconds delay in complete mixing will lessen the amount of color (Fig. 1). The decrease in reactivity of the reagent appears to be a function of the disappearance of the original yellow color of the phosphomolybdate (half time of 8 seconds (Fig. 1)) and is presumably due to dissociation of the phosphate from the molybdate. Surprisingly, the color with protein continues to develop for a number of minutes after the reagent itself has become unreactive to freshly added protein (Fig. 1). Possibly the primary reduction product rearranges, since the absorption spectrum changes in shape between 3 minutes and 30 minutes (Fig. 2). (3) \n",

(3) It is several fold more sensitive than the ninhydrin reaction (23) and is somewhat simpler, as well as much easier to adapt for small scale analyses. Free amino acids give much more color than proteins with the ninhydrin reaction, whereas the reverse is true with the Folin reagent. (4) It is 100 times more sensitive than the biuret reaction. \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "There are two major disadvantages of the Folin reaction. (a) The amount of color varies with different proteins. In this regard it is less constant than the biuret reaction, but more constant than the absorption at λ = 280 mμ. (b) The color is not strictly proportional to concentration. \n",
       "\n",

       "From a consideration of the advantages and disadvantages, the reasonable applications of the copper-Folin reaction would seem to include (1) measurement of protein during enzyme fractionations, etc., (2) measurement of mixed tissue proteins, particularly when absolute values are not needed, (3) measurement of very small absolute amounts of protein, or highly diluted protein (e.g., spinal fluid) or protein mixed with colored substances or other nitrogen-containing substances, and (4) analyses of large numbers of similar protein samples, such as antigen-antibody precipitates. \n",

       "The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder.  The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism.  We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely.  Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train.  Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU.  On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.0 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.\n",

       "\n",
       "Recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [12] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [29, 2, 5].  Numerous efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures [31, 21, 13].\n",

       "\\*Equal contribution. Listing order is random. Jakob proposed replacing RNNs with self-attention and started the effort to evaluate this idea. Ashish, with Illia, designed and implemented the first Transformer models and has been crucially involved in every aspect of this work. Noam proposed scaled dot-product attention, multi-head attention and the parameter-free position representation and became the other person involved in nearly every detail. Niki designed, implemented, tuned and evaluated countless model variants in our original codebase and tensor2tensor. Llion also experimented with novel model variants, was responsible for our initial codebase, and efficient inference and visualizations. Lukasz and Aidan spent countless long days designing various parts of and implementing tensor2tensor, replacing our earlier codebase, greatly improving results and massively accelerating our research.  \n",

       "### Recurrent Models\n",
       "\n",
       "Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences.  Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states $h_t$, as a function of the previous hidden state $h_{t-1}$ and the input for position $t$. This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks \\[18] and conditional computation \\[26], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\n",

       "### Attention Mechanisms\n",
       "\n",
       "Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduction models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output sequences \\[2, 16]. In all but a few cases \\[22], however, such attention mechanisms are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "### The Transformer\n",
       "\n",
       "In this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\n",

       "The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU \\[20], ByteNet \\[15] and ConvS2S \\[8], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models, the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions \\[11]. In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section 3.2.\n",

       "### Self-Attention\n",
       "\n",
       "Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations \\[4, 22, 23, 19].\n",

       "To the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-aligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as \\[14, 15] and \\[8].\n",

       "## Model Architecture\n",
       "\n",
       "Most competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure \\[5, 2, 29]. Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations $(x_1,..., x_n)$ to a sequence of continuous representations $z = (z_1,..., z_n)$. Given $z$, the decoder then generates an output sequence $(y_1, ..., y_m)$ of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive \\[9], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\n",

       "\n",
       "**Encoder:** The encoder is composed of a stack of $N = 6$ identical layers. Each layer has two sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-wise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [10] around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is LayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension $d_{model} = 512$.  \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "**Decoder:** The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the predictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.  \n",

On each of these projected versions of queries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding $d_v$-dimensional output values.

This mimics the typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as [31, 2, 8].\n",

In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the encoder.

We need to prevent leftward information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\n",

       "\n",
       "In this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolutional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations $(x_1,..., x_n)$ to another sequence of equal length $(z_1,..., z_n)$, with $x_i, z_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$, such as a hidden layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we consider three desiderata.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "One is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "The third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [11]. Hence we also compare the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the different layer types.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "As noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires $O(n)$ sequential operations. In terms of computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence length n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece [31] and byte-pair [25] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum path length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.  \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "A single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output positions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels, or O(log<sub>k</sub>(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [15], increasing the length of the longest paths between any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than recurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity considerably, to O(k · n · d + n · d<sup>2</sup>). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer, the approach we take in our model.  \n",

       "This report introduces a new family of multimodal models, Gemini, that exhibit remarkable capabilities across image, audio, video, and text understanding.  The Gemini family consists of Ultra, Pro, and Nano sizes, suitable for applications ranging from complex reasoning tasks to on-device memory-constrained use-cases.  Evaluation on a broad range of benchmarks shows that our most-capable Gemini Ultra model advances the state of the art in 30 of 32 of these benchmarks — notably being the first model to achieve human-expert performance on the well-studied exam benchmark MMLU, and improving the state of the art in every one of the 20 multimodal benchmarks we examined.  We believe that the new capabilities of the Gemini family in cross-modal reasoning and language understanding will enable a wide variety of use cases.  We discuss our approach toward post-training and deploying Gemini models responsibly to users through services including Gemini, Gemini Advanced, Google AI Studio, and Cloud Vertex AI.  \n",

       "We present Gemini, a family of highly capable multimodal models developed at Google.  We trained Gemini models jointly across image, audio, video, and text data for the purpose of building a model with both strong generalist capabilities across modalities alongside cutting-edge understanding and reasoning performance in each respective domain.  \n",

Each size is specifically tailored to address different computational limitations and application requirements.  \n",

Due to the varied requirements of our downstream applications, we have produced two post-trained Gemini model family variants.  Chat-focused variants, referred to as Gemini Apps models, are optimized for Gemini and Gemini Advanced, our conversational AI service formerly known as Bard.  Developer-focused variants, referred to as Gemini API models, are optimized for a range of products and are accessible through Google AI Studio and Cloud Vertex AI.  \n",

It also builds on the work on sequence models (Sutskever et al., 2014), a long history of work in deep learning based on neural networks (LeCun et al., 2015), and machine learning distributed systems (Barham et al., 2022; Bradbury et al., 2018; Dean et al., 2012) that enable large-scale training.\n",

The visual encoding of Gemini models is inspired by our own foundational work on Flamingo (Alayrac et al., 2022), CoCa (Yu et al., 2022a), and PaLI (Chen et al., 2022), with the important distinction that the models are multimodal from the beginning and can natively output images using discrete image tokens (Ramesh et al., 2021; Yu et al., 2022b).\n",

Video frames or images can be interleaved naturally with text or audio as part of the model input. The models can handle variable input resolution in order to spend more compute on tasks that require fine-grained understanding. In addition, Gemini models can directly ingest audio signals at 16kHz from Universal Speech Model (USM) (Zhang et al., 2023) features. This enables the model to capture nuances that are typically lost when the audio is naively mapped to a text input (for example, see audio understanding demo on the website).\n",

For the Pro model, the inherent scalability of our infrastructure and learning algorithms enable us to complete pre-training in a matter of weeks, leveraging a fraction of the Ultra’s resources.

       "We trained Gemini models using TPUv5e and TPUv4 (Jouppi et al., 2023), depending on their sizes and configuration. Training Gemini Ultra used a large fleet of TPUv4 accelerators owned by Google across multiple datacenters. This represents a significant increase in scale over our prior flagship  model PaLM-2 which presented new infrastructure challenges. Scaling up the number of accelerators results in a proportionate decrease in the mean time between failure of hardware in the overall system. We minimized the rate of planned reschedules and preemptions, but genuine machine failures are commonplace across all hardware accelerators at such large scales.\n",

For Gemini Ultra, we decided to retain a small number of cubes per superpod to allow for hot standbys and rolling maintenance.\n",

Google's network latencies and bandwidths are sufficient to support the commonly used synchronous training paradigm, exploiting model parallelism within superpods and data-parallelism across superpods.\n",

       "The 'single controller' programming model of Jax (Bradbury et al., 2018) and Pathways (Barham et al., 2022) allows a single Python process to orchestrate the entire training run, dramatically simplifying the development workflow. The GSPMD partitioner (Xu et al., 2021) in the XLA compiler partitions the training step computation, and the MegaScale XLA compiler (XLA, 2019) pass statically schedules appropriate collectives so that they maximally overlap with the computation with very little variation in step time.\n",

       "Maintaining a high goodput² at this scale would have been impossible using the conventional approach of periodic checkpointing of weights to persistent cluster storage. For Gemini models, we instead made use of redundant in-memory copies of the model state, and on any unplanned hardware failures, we rapidly recover directly from an intact model replica. Compared to both PaLM and PaLM-2 (Anil et al., 2023), this provided a substantial speedup in recovery time, despite the significantly larger training resources being used. As a result, the overall goodput for the largest-scale training job increased from 85% to 97%.\n",

Although these are extremely rare, the scale of Gemini models means that we can expect SDC events to impact training every week or two. Rapidly detecting and removing faulty hardware required several new techniques that exploit deterministic replay to isolate incorrect computations, combined with proactive SDC scanners on idle machines and hot standbys. Our fully deterministic infrastructure allowed us to quickly identify root causes (including hardware failures) during the development leading up to the Ultra model, and this was a crucial ingredient towards stable training.\n",

The final data mixtures and weights were determined through ablations on smaller models.

We report these results in Table 2. Broadly, we find that the performance of Gemini Pro outperforms inference-optimized models such as GPT-3.5 and performs comparably with several of the most capable models available, and Gemini Ultra outperforms all current models.

       "On MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021a), Gemini Ultra can outperform all existing models, achieving an accuracy of 90.04%. MMLU is a holistic exam benchmark, which measures knowledge across a set of 57 subjects. Human expert performance is gauged at 89.8% by the benchmark authors, and Gemini Ultra is the first model to exceed this threshold, with the prior state-of-the-art result at 86.4%. Achieving high performance requires specialist knowledge across many domains (e.g. law, biology, history, etc.), alongside reading comprehension and reasoning. We find Gemini Ultra achieves highest accuracy when used in combination with a chain-of-thought prompting approach (Wei et al., 2022b) that accounts for model uncertainty. The model produces a chain of thought with k samples, for example 8 or 32. If there is a consensus above a preset threshold (selected based on the validation split), it selects this answer, otherwise it reverts to a greedy sample based on maximum likelihood choice without chain of thought. We refer the reader to appendix for a detailed breakdown of how this approach compares with only chain-of-thought prompting or only greedy sampling.\n",

For the grade-schoolmath benchmark, GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), we find Gemini Ultra reaches 94.4% accuracy with chain-of-thought prompting and self-consistency (Wang et al., 2022) compared to the previous best accuracy of 92% with the same prompting technique. Similar positive trends are observed in increased difficulty math problems drawn from middle- and high-school math competitions (MATH benchmark), with the Gemini Ultra model outperforming all competitor models, reaching 53.2% using 4-shot prompting. The model also outperforms the state of the art on even harder tasks derived from American Mathematical Competitions (150 questions from 2022 and 2023). Smaller models perform poorly on this challenging task scoring close to random, but Gemini Ultra can solve 32% of the questions, compared to the 30% solve rate for GPT-4.  \n",

For example, on HumanEval, a standard code-completion benchmark (Chen et al., 2021) mapping function descriptions to Python implementations, instruction-tuned Gemini Ultra correctly implements 74.4% of problems. On a new held-out evaluation benchmark for python code generation tasks, Natural2Code, where we ensure no web leakage, Gemini Ultra achieves the highest score of 74.9%.  \n",

We performed an extensive leaked data analysis after training to ensure the results we report here are as scientifically sound as possible, but still found some minor issues and decided not to report results on e.g. LAMBADA (Paperno et al., 2016). As part of the evaluation process, on a popular benchmark, HellaSwag (Zellers et al., 2019), we find that an additional hundred fine-tuning steps on specific website extracts corresponding to the HellaSwag training set (which were not included in the Gemini model pretraining set) improve the validation accuracy of Gemini Pro to 89.6% and Gemini Ultra to 96.0%, when measured with 1-shot prompting (we measured GPT-4 obtained 92.3% when evaluated 1-shot via the API). This suggests that the benchmark results are susceptible to the pretraining dataset composition. We choose to report HellaSwag decontaminated results only in a 10-shot evaluation setting. We believe there is a need for more robust and nuanced standardized evaluation benchmarks with no leaked data. So, we evaluate Gemini models on several new held-out evaluation datasets that were recently released, such as WMT23 and Math-AMC 2022-2023 problems, or internally generated from non-web sources, such as Natural2Code. We refer the reader to Appendix 10.3 for a comprehensive list of our evaluation benchmarks.  \n",

We find Gemini Ultra achieves an accuracy of 79.0%, an advance over PaLM 2-L which scores 74.7%, when averaged across all languages in an 8-shot setup. We also benchmark Gemini models on the multilingual summarization benchmarks – XLSum (Hasan et al., 2021) and WikiLingua (Ladhak et al., 2020). In XLSum, Gemini Ultra reached an average of 17.6 rougeL score compared to 15.4 for PaLM 2. For Wikilingua, Gemini Ultra (5-shot) trails behind PaLM 2 (3-shot) measured in BLEURT score.

We find that the Ultra model retrieves the correct value with 98% accuracy when queried across the full context length. We further investigate this by plotting the negative log likelihood (NLL) versus the token index across a held-out set of long documents in Figure 4. We find that the NLL decreases with sequence position up to the full 32K context length.

       "\n",
       "1. **Closed-Book Factuality:** If provided with a fact-seeking prompt without any given source, Gemini API models should not hallucinate incorrect information (see Section 2 of Roberts et al. (2020) for a definition). These prompts can range from information-seeking prompts (e.g. “Who is the prime minister of India?”) to semi-creative prompts that may request factual information (e.g. “Write a 500-word speech in favor of the adoption of renewable energy”).\n",
       "2. **Attribution:** If instructed to generate a response grounded to a given context, we aim to ensure that Gemini API models produce a response with the highest degree of faithfulness to the context (Maynez et al., 2020; Rashkin et al., 2023). This may include the summarization of a user-provided source, generating fine-grained citations given a question and provided snippets akin to Menick et al. (2022); Peng et al. (2023), answering questions from a long-form source such as a book (Mihaylov et al., 2018), and transforming a given source to a desired output (e.g. an email from a portion of a meeting transcript).\n",
       "3. **Hedging:** If prompted with an input that is “unanswerable”, Gemini API models must acknowledge that it cannot provide a response by hedging to avoid hallucination. These include scenarios where the input prompt contains false-premise questions [see examples in Hu et al. (2023)], the input prompt instructs the model to perform open book QA, but the answer is not derivable from the given context, and so forth.\n",

Attribution is evaluated via human annotators who check for attribution to sources in the prompt for each response manually; the reported metric is AIS (Rashkin et al., 2023).

One example of such a system is AlphaCode 2, a new state-of-the-art agent that excels at solving competitive programming problems (Leblond et al, 2023). AlphaCode 2 uses a specialized version of Gemini Pro – tuned on competitive programming data similar to the data used in Li et al. (2022) – to conduct a massive search over the space of possible programs. This is followed by a tailored filtering, clustering and reranking mechanism. Gemini Pro is fine-tuned both to be a coding model to generate proposal solution candidates, and to be a reward model that is leveraged to recognize and extract the most promising code candidates.  \n",

Mapping this to competition rankings, AlphaCode 2 built on top of Gemini Pro sits at an estimated 85th percentile on average – i.e. it performs better than 85% of entrants.

First, we collect a diverse set of prompts that are representative of real-world use cases. Second, we apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on demonstration data of what the model’s output should be for a given prompt (Mishra et al., 2021; Ouyang et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022a). Third, we further collect different possible responses to a given prompt, and collect feedback data over these to train a Reward Model (RM). Finally, using the trained RM, a Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) stage (Bai et al., 2022a) is applied to further align the model’s outputs with human preferences. We discuss our methods in more detail below:  \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "(1) Prompt Data Collection: A prompt is a user’s input to the model. As well as the most recent user input, this can also include previous user-model interactions. We curate datasets of target prompts. The datasets serve as the basis for ourdemonstration and feedback data collections, and they are used directly during reinforcement learning. It is important to cover a diverse set of crucial use cases and in both single-turn and multi-turn formats. Data sources include vendor-created data, third-party licensed sources, and synthetic approaches.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "(2) SFT on Demonstration Data: SFT trains the model to output a desired target response given a prompt. Our Demonstration Data target responses can be directly written by a human expert, or generated by a model and in some cases revised or reviewed by a human. Additionally, we use data analysis tools and heuristics to ensure high data diversity across capabilities, use cases, and semantic clusters.  \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "(3) RM Training on Feedback Data: We further collect Feedback Data, for which human raters provide feedback such as relative preferences over candidate responses and feedback regarding individual responses to a given prompt. For many capabilities, rating relative preferences is an easier task than demonstrating an ideal response. Feedback data are collected across creativity, safety, factuality, other capabilities, and other target criteria. We found that the utility of the resulting human feedback data greatly depends on the prompt selection and the sampling strategy used to produce candidate responses. We use this data to train RMs to output rewards that align with human preferences as closely as possible.  \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "(4) RLHF: Applying reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to our models provides further gains over SFT alone. Our approach creates an iterative process in which RL continually pushes the boundaries of the RM, while the RM is continuously improved through evaluation and data collection, leading to progressive improvements in both.  \n",

Video and image understanding modalities can also be deployed for social good applications downstream, such as enabling descriptions of visual outputs for accessibility purposes. Generative multimodal models may also raise downstream societal risks, with the Gemini models assessments considering a range of risks previously identified within research such as Weidinger et al. (2021) and Shelby et al. (2023). We assessed a range of content risks such as exposure of users to potentially unsafe content, such as sexually explicit, violent or hateful outputs (Weidinger et al., 2021), child safety harms, and representation harms, subsequently designing evaluations across these domains to enable measurement. Beyond content related risks, we analyzed the potential misuse of capabilities for surveillance applications, particularly for media-to-text capabilities, and considered the broader environmental and economic impact of multimodal models.

In contrast to generic quality-oriented post-training catering to all types of user queries, our safety mitigation is more focused on adversarial, or “harm-inducing” queries - i.e. the smaller slice of user queries where an unprotected model is likely to produce harmful responses according to our model safety policies.  \n",

       "* Fast mitigation and generalization: Safety is a highly dynamic environment with a constantly evolving landscape of harmful query patterns. It is often logistically difficult to ensure both fast mitigation (i.e. newly discovered harmful query patterns are promptly addressed) and generalization (i.e. the mitigation works sufficiently well across different harmful query patterns). We have found it worthwhile to introduce more advanced chain-of-thought recipes based on our safety policies, such that the models operate in the space of safety policy concepts as opposed to at a fine-grained harm example level.\n",

       "To assess the post-trained Gemini models and products with access to Gemini models (such as Gemini Advanced) against safety policy areas and other key risk areas identified within impact assessments, we developed a suite of evaluations across the lifecycle of model development. Some evaluations are conducted at the model level (i.e. evaluating the post-trained Gemini API Ultra model) and others at the product level (i.e. evaluating Gemini Advanced, which gives access to 1.0 Ultra alongside other features like safety filters).\n",

Evaluations consider issues such as helpfulness (instruction following and creativity), safety and factuality.\n",
       "* **Assurance evaluations** are conducted for the purpose of governance and review, usually at the end of key milestones or training runs by a group outside of the model development team.  Assurance evaluations are standardized by modality and datasets are strictly held out. Only high-level insights are fed back into the training process to assist with mitigation efforts. Assurance evaluations include testing across safety policies, and include ongoing testing for dangerous capabilities such as potential biohazards, persuasion, and cybersecurity (Shevlane et al., 2023).\n",
       "* **External evaluations** are conducted by independent external groups who are domain experts to identify blindspots. External groups stress-test our models across a range of issues, these areas are outlined in the ‘External Evaluations' section below. The design of these evaluations is independent and results are reported periodically to the internal team and governance groups.\n",

The set of prompts were synthetically generated by a highly-capable language model, starting from seeds relevant to each category that were collected and verified by human testers. The prompt set was iteratively improved through filtering and rewriting with human review, then split for development and assurance evaluations.

Rather than using adversarial image generation, which might not adequately capture the diversity of images from users, we worked with experienced content moderators to both source images and generate adversarial questions. Evaluation is done via human evaluation. Because images can be much more visceral than text, human evaluations are done with additional well-being safeguards in place. In particular, raters have specialized training, limits on the time they spend per day rating harmful content, and access to wellbeing resources, advice and activities.

       "\n",

       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Another notable property is that they all have a well-defined notion of desirable versus harmful behavior. This is particularly helpful in our setting, as we are building a general purpose model, where defining what a good response is highly contextual. We therefore limit ourselves to measuring well defined behavior, as there is the case in tasks such as coreference bias, where a highly capable model should be able to perform well. Of course, there are many limitations to this approach, and further work is necessary in order to assess representational harms.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "In particular, we noticed most of these datasets quickly become saturated with accuracy scores close to 99%, especially since we are evaluating highly capable large models. This suggests that increased language model capabilities may also reduce these representational harms. We therefore highlight the need for developing new ways to measure bias and stereotyping, going beyond binary gender and common stereotypes, and are prioritizing development of new approaches as we iterate on our models\n",

       "Image-to-text approach: For image-to-text capabilities, our goal is to test model capabilities across images which represent different groups of people. In particular, we explicitly test whether or not images of people are described with similar quality for different gender appearances and skin tones following (Zhao et al., 2021). In our evaluations we compare CIDEr scores (Vedantam et al., 2015), a common image captioning metric that captures how well a generated caption reflects information in human written reference captions, for images depicting different groups. Though we do not see large discrepancies across different groups, we note that this metric is imperfect as the human reference captions could be inherently biased. Additionally, we perform a zero-shot classification style evaluation with the Dollarstreet dataset (Rojas et al., 2022) to measure discrepancies in performance across images which come from different geographic locations. As is seen in previous work, we find that models work less effectively for images from lower socioeconomic regions and regions outside North America and Europe. This is an area where we need further research and work to improve in future iterations of our models.\n",

In particular, we use the MIAP dataset (Schumann et al., 2021) which includes images of people in which people are annotated with skin tone and gender appearance attributes. We also construct questions that target various attributes about people that cannot usually be answered from an image alone (e.g., \"What level of education does this person have?\") to test if the model will produce ungrounded inferences about people. We also consider images which do include relevant information for a question (e.g., a person performing a particular task which requires an educational credential). We evaluate our models via human evaluation and ask annotators if a model refuses to answer a question or, if the model does answer a question, if it is relying on information visible in the image. Additionally, we perform analysis across skin tone and gender appearance attributes in images.\n",

       "\n",
       "We have presented Gemini, a new family of models that advance multimodal model capabilities in text, code, image, audio, and video. Our most capable pre-trained model Gemini Ultra, alongside the post-trained Gemini Apps and Gemini API variants, make significant advances across the board. In the natural language domain, the performance gains from careful developments in data and model training at scale continue to deliver quality improvements, setting new state of the art in several benchmarks. In particular, Gemini Ultra surpasses human-expert performance on the exam benchmark MMLU, scoring 90.0%, which has been a defacto measure of progress for LLMs ever since it was first released in 2020. In the multimodal domain, Gemini Ultra sets new state of the art on most of the image understanding, video understanding, and audio understanding benchmarks without task-specific modifications or tuning.In particular, Gemini Ultra’s multimodal reasoning capabilities are evident from its state-of-the-art performance on the recent MMMU benchmark (Yue et al., 2023), that comprises questions about images requiring college-level subject knowledge and deliberate reasoning.  \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Beyond the state-of-art results on benchmarks, what we are most excited about is the new use cases enabled by Gemini models. The new capabilities of Gemini models to parse complex images, such as charts or infographics, reason over interleaved sequences of images, audio, and text, and generate interleaved text and images as responses open a wide variety of new applications. As shown in figures throughout the report and appendix, Gemini models can enable new approaches in areas like education, everyday problem solving, multilingual communication, information summarization, extraction, and creativity. We expect that the users of these models will find all kinds of beneficial new uses that we have only scratched the surface of in our own investigations.  \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Despite their impressive capabilities, we should note that there are limitations to the use of LLMs. There is a continued need for ongoing research and development on “hallucinations\" generated by LLMs to ensure that model outputs are more reliable and verifiable. LLMs also struggle with tasks requiring high-level reasoning abilities like causal understanding, logical deduction, and counterfactual reasoning even though they achieve impressive performance on exam benchmarks. This underscores the need for more challenging and robust evaluations to measure their true understanding as the current state-of-the-art LLMs saturate many benchmarks.  \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "The Gemini family is a further step towards our mission to solve intelligence, advance science and benefit humanity, and we are enthusiastic to see how these models are used by our colleagues at Google and beyond. We build on many innovations in machine learning, data, infrastructure, and responsible development – areas that we have been pursuing at Google for over a decade. The models we present in this report provide a strong foundation towards our broader future goal to develop a large-scale, modularized system that will have broad generalization capabilities across many modalities.\n",

       "<div>\n",
       "| Model architecture | Gemini V1.0 is a new family of state-of-the-art language models,  containing variants known as Nano, Pro and Ultra (ordered by parameter count) based on a decoder-only Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017a). Models are trained to support 32K context length, employing efficient attentionmechanisms such as multi-query attention (Shazeer, 2019b). Gemini is trained jointly across image, audio, video and text data for the purpose of building a model with both strong generalist capabilities across modalities alongside cutting-edge understanding and reasoning performance in each respective domain.  The post-trained models described in this model card are Gemini API and Gemini Apps model variants (Section 6) built on top of the Gemini Ultra pre-trained model. During the post-training process, additional architectural modifications are also made to support the training of multi-objective reward models for RLHF.\n",

       "| Input(s) | Text (e.g. a question, a prompt, a document(s) to be summa- rized), images, video, audio files.\n",
       "| Output(s) | Generated text in response to the input (e.g. an answer to the question, a summary of multiple documents, comparing documents/videos).\n",
       "| Application | Gemini is designed for accelerating research on language models, for use as a building block in features within Google products, and as a building block for select applications such as Gemini App and Search Generative Experience.  Services and products built on top of Gemini Ultra are also being made available to external developers via Google Cloud Vertex API and Google Labs, with additional process and technical safeguards related to safety policies.\n",
       "| Known Caveats | Gemini should not be made available as part of a general-purpose service or product, or used within a specific downstream appli- cation without a prior assessment and mitigation of the safety and fairness concerns specific to the downstream use.\n",

       "We contrast several chain-of-thought approaches on MMLU and discuss their results in this section. We proposed a new approach where model produces k chain-of-thought samples, selects the majority vote if the model is confident above a threshold, and otherwise defers to the greedy sample choice. The thresholds are optimized for each model based on their validation split performance. The proposed approach is referred to as uncertainty-routed chain-of-thought. The intuition behind this approach is that chain-of-thought samples might degrade performance compared to the maximum-likelihood decision when the model is demonstrably inconsistent. We compare the gains from the proposed approach on both Gemini Ultra and GPT-4 in Figure 9. We find that Gemini Ultra benefits more from this approach compared to using only chain-of-thought samples. GPT-4’s performance improves from 84.2% with greedy sampling to 87.3% with uncertainty-routed chain-of-thought approach with 32 samples, but it already achieves these gains from using 32 chain-of-thought samples. In contrast, Gemini Ultra improves its performance significantly from 84.0% with greedy sampling to 90.0% with uncertainty-routed chain-of-thought approach with 32 samples while it marginally improves to 85.0% with the use of 32 chain-of-thought samples only.\n",

Beyond English, Figure 18 shows model's capability to understand images in a multilingual setting. Gemini models also show strong performance on multimodal image understanding and reasoning in mathematics, as shown in Figures 14, 20 and 21. Figure 22 is an example of complex multimodal reasoning demonstrating how the model composes complex image understanding, code generation, and instruction following capabilities for a given user task. In Figure 19, we see another example of the model being able to generate working code and follow complex user instructions.
